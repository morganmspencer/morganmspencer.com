## Goals and Objectives

My client wanted to increase the web presence of her business with a new website. She wanted a website that showcased the services she has to offer in a simple to navigate format. The objective for this project was to give potential customers more information and an easy way to contact the client.

## Creative Strategy

Maurchi had an existing brand which we combined into a modern format to create the final website. As the client was looking for something easy to navigate, I created minimalist pages and templates that gave visitors just what they were looking for.
