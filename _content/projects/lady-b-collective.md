## Goals and Objectives

The goal for Lady B Collective was fairly simple: to create the blog and shop from scratch. This was not a conversion or new look, so everything had to be built from the ground up. Therefore, the goal was to make the brand known and generate readers and customers.

## Creative Strategy

The client gave a specific style that she was looking for with this brand and website: badass feminine. During the logo creation process we were able to expand on this idea and find the right balance. This then translated into the look and feel for the website.

## Client Testimonial

> “When I met with Morgan, he was very receptive of my thoughts and wants regarding the website. I wanted someone who was able to produce what I wanted, in a timely manner, but be flexible in the nature of the work. After speaking with him, I knew it would be a great fit.
>I highly recommend Spencer Creative Co. for any projects. They are open-minded, efficient, easy to work with, and will get you the results you want.”
