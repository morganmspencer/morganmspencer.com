## Goals and Objectives

The main goal was to create a brand around Kateâ€™s various skills and a website to compliment them. There was no previous website or branding, so we created everything from scratch.

## Creative Strategy
We identified the need to highlight the individual aspects of the Kate Haus brand. Maintaining a consistent shape but combining colors with each aspect of the art allowed for a unified brand with each sub-aspect. We then took the design aesthetic and applied it to a minimal and refined design.
