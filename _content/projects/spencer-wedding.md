## Goals and Objectives

The objective for this project was to create each requested product in a manner that meets the specific timelines required in the wedding industry.

## Creative Strategy

I created a brand for the Spencers, including a logo, color scheme, and typography, which formed a strategy that could be used across many different mediums.
