## Goals and Objectives

Entellect was looking for a complete website redesign to better align with modern methods and practices. The website is a key tool for Entellect's new client acquisition and to provide information and updates.

## Creative Strategy

Entellect's previous website was not up to modern standards, namely, it was not responsive for mobile devices. The new website needed to solve this as well as provide an easy way to share news updates and events from the company. I went with a flattened design to remove the dated look and fleshed out the color scheme to utilize it better.

## Technologies Used

WordPress, TailwindCSS, Figma
