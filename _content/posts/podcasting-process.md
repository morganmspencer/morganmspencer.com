Every week I create a new episode of my podcast [Business for Designers and Developers](https://open.spotify.com/show/0YBqtNJ4TLAqUEUZ3qkv6O). I created this podcast to provide quick tips to creatives to grow their business. The podcast has the side benefits of improving my personal brand and potentially [gaining new clients](/learn/podcasting/new-clients-podcasting). But it wouldn’t be as successful without a solid process and framework.

## Pre-Recording

Before I get started recording of course I need a topic. Getting started with a blank slate is incredibly difficult. Plus, being put on the spot to think up an idea is always harder. I tend to come up with ideas throughout my daily life. When I do I quickly make a note on my phone or set up a draft post with the idea. When it comes time to write a post for the week I can go through the ideas and pick one. I typically have about 30 ideas to choose from which makes things much easier.

I then do any research related to the topic and write a blog post with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). Writing helps me to gather my thoughts and properly present my idea. At least right now as I’m starting out I don’t feel comfortable enough to record a podcast from scratch. Writing also sets up a lot of the backend work for the podcast.

## Recording

Once I’ve written my blog post I’m ready to record. I use [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) to record and edit my podcast episode. I use my blog post as a guide to keep me on track and make sure I hit all of my topics. Most importantly, I try not to read off the post as it would then sound too scripted. Once the recording is done I do some quick sound edits to remove background noise, mess with the highs and lows, and more. I slap on the intro and outro, then export the audio file.

## Post-Recording and Publishing

Once I have the audio file I upload it to [Transistor](https://transistor.fm/), my podcast host. I use my template for creating the episode artwork and add any applicable links in the show notes. After adding all the data I schedule it to publish or I publish it immediately. I take the episode and embed it in my blog post before publishing that.

From here it is all about repurposing the content to all forms of social media. First, I copy the blog post as an article to both [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganmspencer/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@morganmspencer). This can help drive traffic to these accounts but also pushes traffic to my [podcast](https://bddpodcast.com/) and [blog](https://creativecachemultisitenetwork.kinsta.cloud/). Transistor automatically tweets out my new episode to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/morganmspencer) account. I create an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/morgan.m.spencer/) post with the episode artwork and I’m working on designing some carousels with the distilled down information. I share directly from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0YBqtNJ4TLAqUEUZ3qkv6O) to my Instagram and Snapchat stories. And finally, I post to my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/morganmatthewspencer/) page.

The process is always evolving, especially in regards to posting to social media channels. I’m always exploring new avenues and methods to publish about the content.
